                        	     <p class="p">IPsec implements network layer encryption and authentication, embedding end-to-end
                              security within the network architecture. The advantage to this is that individual
                              applications do not need to be modified to take advantage of strong security. All
                              packets routed through the network are automatically secured.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">IPsec provides secure <em class="ph i">tunnels</em> between two peers, such as two switches. You define which packets are considered sensitive and should be sent through these
                              secure tunnels. You define the parameters which should be used to protect these sensitive packets, by specifying characteristics
                              of these tunnels. Marked packets are locally redirected to the tunnel interface as shown in the following image.

                           <h2>IPsec Security Associations</h2>
                           <p class="p">More accurately, tunnels are sets of <em class="ph i">security associations</em> (SAs) that are
                              established between two IPsec peers. The security associations define which protocols
                              and algorithms should be applied to sensitive packets, and also specify the keying
                              material to be used by the two peers. Security associations are unidirectional and are
                              established per security protocol. 
                           </p>
                           
        
                           
                           <p class="p">Once established, the set of security associations (outbound, to the peer) is then
                              applied to the triggering packet as well as to subsequent applicable packets as those
                              packets exit the device. <em class="ph i">Applicable packets</em> are packets that match the same
                              criteria that the original packet matched. For example, all applicable packets could be
                              encrypted before being forwarded to the remote peer. The corresponding inbound security
                              associations are used when processing the incoming traffic from that peer.
                           </p>

                           <h2>Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE)</h2>

                               <p class="p">If no security association exists that IPsec can use to protect this traffic to the peer,
                              IPsec uses the Internet Key Exchange protocol (IKE) to negotiate with the remote peer to
                              set up the necessary IPsec security associations on behalf of the data flow.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">If IKE is used to establish the security associations, the security associations will
                              have lifetimes set so that they periodically expire and require renegotiation, thus
                              providing an additional level of security.
                           </p>
                           
                           <h2>IPsec Transform Sets</h2>
                           
                           <p class="p">A transform set is an acceptable combination of security protocols, algorithms, and other
                              settings to apply to IPsec protected traffic. During the IPsec security association
                              negotiation, the peers agree to use a particular transform set when protecting a
                              particular data flow.
                           </p>
