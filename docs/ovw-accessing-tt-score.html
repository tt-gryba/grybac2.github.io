title: Accessing TT Score
---

<!--<p>Before you begin using TT&reg; Score, contact your Customer Success representative to activate TT Score for your company. Trading Technologies will also work with you to complete any steps needed to make your data available to be analyzed.</p>

<p>After you're allowed access and the steps are completed, a TT Onboarding Manager will contact you to enable permissions in your company to run TT Score. Permissions are enabled using the Setup application on TT.</p>

<p>If you need permissions to enable these settings in Setup, please contact your company administrator.</p>-->

<p>TT Score provides you the ability to analyze your own trading activity for potential regulatory concerns. Users can also be given administrator-level permissions to view the activity of all users on the accounts to which they have access or all users across an entire company.</p>
