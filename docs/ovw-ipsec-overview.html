                           <p class="p">A secure network starts with a strong security policy that defines the freedom of access
                              to information and dictates the deployment of security in the network. Cisco Systems
                              offers many technology solutions for building a custom security solution for Internet,
                              extranet, intranet, and remote access networks. These scalable solutions seamlessly
                              interoperate to deploy enterprise-wide network security. Cisco System's IPsec delivers a
                              key technology component for providing a total security solution. Cisco's IPsec offering
                              provides privacy, integrity, and authenticity for transmitting sensitive information
                              over the Internet.
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">Cisco's end-to-end offering allows customers to implement IPsec transparently into the
                              network infrastructure without affecting individual workstations
                           </p>
                           
                           <p class="p">IPsec is a framework of open standards for ensuring secure private communications over
                              the Internet. Based on standards developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force
                              (IETF), IPsec ensures confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of data
                              communications across a public network. IPsec provides a necessary component of a
                              standards-based, flexible solution for deploying a network-wide security policy.

                           <p class="p">IPsec protects IP datagrams by defining a method of specifying the traffic to protect,
                              how that traffic is to be protected, and to whom the traffic is sent.

                           <p class="p">By implementing security at the IP level, an organization can ensure secure networking
                              not only for applications that have security mechanisms but also for the many
                              security-ignorant applications. IPsec provides the capability to secure communications
                              across a LAN, across private and public WANs, and across the Internet. Examples of its
                              use include:

                                 <p class="p">Secure branch office connectivity over the Internet: A company can build a secure
                                    virtual private network over the Internet or over a public WAN. This enables a
                                    business to rely heavily on the Internet and reduce its need for private
                                    networks, saving costs and network management overhead.

                                    (ISP) and gain secure access to a company network. This reduces the cost of toll

                                    electronic commerce on the Internet have relied upon securing Web traffic with
                                    SSL since that is commonly found in Web browsers and is easy to set up and run.
                                    There are new proposals that may utilize IPsec for electronic commerce.

                              that it can encrypt or authenticate all traffic at the IP level. Thus, all distributed

                              scenario, traffic on each LAN does not need any special protection, but the devices on
                              the LAN can be protected from the untrusted network with firewalls.

                              IPsec protocols to protect their access. These protocols can operate in networking
                              devices, such as a router or firewall that connects each LAN to the outside world, or
                              they can operate directly on the workstation or server.

                           <p class="p">In Fig1, the user workstation connected to one of the CPEs in a customer site can
                              establish an IPsec tunnel with the network devices to protect all the subsequent
                              sessions. After this tunnel is established, the workstation can have many different
                              sessions with the devices behind these IPsec gateways. The packets going across the
                              Internet will be protected by IPsec, but will be delivered onto each LAN as a normal IP
                              packet.
